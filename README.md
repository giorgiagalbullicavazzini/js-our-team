# Our Team

- The purpose of the code is to create a staff info page;
- The first thing to do is to create an empty array;
- For each team member, we can then add an object to the array;
- The object contains the name, the role and a photo of the specific team member;

## Milestone 1

- To check if the code is correct, we can then console print all the single information for every team member;

## Milestone 2

- To transform our project into a visual one, we can then print all the information as strings in our DOM;

## Bonus 1

- To give our project its final look, we can transform the photo string into an image;

## Bonus 2

- Finally, we can use CSS to create the style of our final page.
